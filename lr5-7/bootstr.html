            <div>
                <p>What do you think of when you think of "big data"?</p>
                <p>For many, it's a nebulous term that invokes images of huge server farms humming away. Or perhaps you think of receiving some kind of personalized advertisement from a retailer.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">But big data is so much deeper and broader than that. I believe there are 10 major areas in which big data is currently being used to excellent advantage in practice - but within those arenas, data can be put to almost any purpose.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">1. Understanding and Targeting Customers</p>
                <p>This is one of the biggest and most publicized areas of big data use today. Here, big data is used to better understand customers and their behaviors and preferences. Companies are keen to expand their traditional data sets with social media data, browser logs as well as text analytics and sensor data to get a more complete picture of their customers. The big objective, in many cases, is to create predictive models.</p>
                <p>You might remember the example of U.S. retailer Target, who is now able to very accurately predict when one of their customers will expect a baby. Using big data, Telecom companies can now better predict customer churn; Wal-Mart can predict what products will sell; and car insurance companies understand how well their customers actually drive.</p>
                <p>Ski resorts are even using data to understand and target their patrons. RFID tags inserted into lift tickets can cut back on fraud and wait times at the lifts, as well as help ski resorts understand traffic patterns, which lifts and runs are most popular at which times of day, and even help track the movements of an individual skier if he were to become lost.</p>
                <p>Imagine being an avid skier and receiving customized invitations from your favorite resort when there's fresh powder on your favorite run, or text alerts letting you know when the lift lines are shortest. They've also taken the data to the people, providing websites and apps that will display your day's stats, from how many runs you slalomed to how many vertical feet you traversed, which you can then share on social media or use to compete with family and friends.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Even government election campaigns can be optimised using big data analytics. Some believe Obama's win after the 2012 presidential election campaign was due to his team's superior ability to use big data analytics.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;">2. Progress bar</p>
                <div class="progress ghh" id="df">
                    <div id="dff" class="progress-bar progress-bar-striped progress-bar-animated" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="75" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width: 0%"></div>
                  </div>
                <button data-value='100' id="dfff" type="button" class="btn btn-primary rar text-nowrap pickc">Click on me</button>
            </div>
